# NSubsys
To use this project, simply add this by looking up `NSubsys` on NuGet Package Manager on Visual Studio or by doing `dotnet add package NSubsys` on your project's root folder.

The patching process will only be done on [Self-contained Publish](http://ttu.github.io/dotnet-core-self-contained-deployments/).
Running the project on Debug or Release mode wont trigger the package.
